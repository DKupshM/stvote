# STVOTE

## Purpose

This project was designed to try to understand the single transferrable vote system in the student government election. This allows for the visualization of voting data, live tabulation system, and the ability to change election settings.

## Data

All data used in this project was obtained through several CPRA requests to the various student governments. The data was reformated to suit the tabulator's needs. Unfortunately, some universities scramble the data making it so graphs like vote over time may not be accurate.

## Planned Features

There are several planned features for this project. Here are what I'm currently planning:

* Create a customizable first choice vote percentage pie or line graph.
* Improve the settings page to allow adjusting of quota and STV Formulas.
* Change party color and candidate color.
* Graphs to showcase vote data over multiple races (For instance, if you vote for one candidate in the race, what about the other)

## Related Work

This work is inspired by a few projects:

* UCSB's UC STV Tabulator which provides live tabulation in Python.
* UC Davis ASUCSB vote system which generates graphs following the election.
* RCViz (now not working) which created sankey graphs for US elections.
